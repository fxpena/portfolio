I developed pipelines for data acquisition and analysis in order to investigate the neural mechanisms of eating in the absence of hunger. Here are links to my github repositories that have demos.

## Neural data analysis
I developed a [toolbox](https://github.com/fxpena/neural_decoding) for decoding information on neural activity. The functions available from sklearn are useful for many types of decoding analyses, and my functions build on those tools by preprocessing data for neural recordings that are not recorded simultaneously but can be used together to create a pseudo-simultaneous neural population.

## Behavior data analysis
I made part of the analysis available on [Github](https://github.com/fxpena/behavior_timestamps) and I included a notebook to demonstrate examples of some of the functions. Although Matlab notebooks cannot be viewed without Matlab, you can view a PDF of the demo file [here](https://github.com/fxpena/behavior_timestamps/blob/main/demo_BehaviorData.pdf).
