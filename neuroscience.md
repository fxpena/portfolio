I developed pipelines for data acquisition and analysis in order to investigate the neural mechanisms of eating in the absence of hunger. I made part of the analysis available on [Github](https://github.com/fxpena/behavior_timestamps) and I included a notebook to demonstrate examples of some of the functions. Although Matlab notebooks cannot be viewed without Matlab, you can view a PDF of the demo file [here](https://github.com/fxpena/behavior_timestamps/blob/main/demo_BehaviorData.pdf).
