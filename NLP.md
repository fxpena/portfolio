### Natural language processing
One of the areas for data science growth in healthcare is the application of natural language processing (NLP) on unstructured data such as notes sections of electronic health records or voice recordings of patients. To gain hands-on experience with NLP, I entered a Kaggle competition to use NLP to determine whether a tweet such as "Fire near Main street" is about an emergency/disater. See my notebook with results [here](https://www.kaggle.com/franciscoxpena/nlp-evaluating-disaster-tweets). If I were to spend more time on this project, I would implement a more sophisticated approach that included using a pre-trained neural network for NLP such as BERT.
