title: Classifying tweets

### Natural language processing
I entered a Kaggle competition to use natural language processing (NLP) to determine whether a tweet such as "Fire near Main street" is about an emergency/disater. See my notebook with results [here](https://www.kaggle.com/franciscoxpena/nlp-evaluating-disaster-tweets). If I were to spend more time on this project, I would use a more sophisticated approach that included using a pre-trained neural network for NLP such as BERT.
