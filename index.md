# Data Scientist

In the past five years as a graduate research fellow in Neurobiology and Behavior at Columbia University I have gained deep experience with data exploration and analysis. In the next phase of my career, I want to apply my passion for data-driven methods to analyze untapped healthcare system functions. I've featured a few small projects in this portfolio to give a taste of my skills and interests as they relate to data science.
