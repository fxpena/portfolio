## Professional summary

I’m a data scientist with a PhD from Columbia University and a background in neuroscience and quantitative modeling. Over the past several years, I’ve applied advanced analytics, machine learning, and data engineering to solve real-world problems in financial services.

At [Humankind Investments](https://humankind.co), I’ve built predictive models, experimentation frameworks, and data pipelines that power marketing analytics, investment research, and compliance automation. My work spans from forecasting user behavior and optimizing conversion funnels to developing an LLM-powered data extraction system for equity research.

Across my projects, I focus on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights, cutting through the noise and applying technical rigor. I’m passionate about designing data systems that not only generate measurable business impact but also make analytics accessible and scalable.
