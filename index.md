## Professional summary

I’m a data scientist with a PhD from Columbia University and a background in neuroscience and quantitative modeling. Over the past several years, I’ve applied advanced analytics, machine learning, and data engineering to solve real-world problems in financial services.

At Humankind Investments, I’ve built predictive models, experimentation frameworks, and data pipelines that power marketing analytics, investment research, and compliance automation. My work spans from forecasting user behavior and optimizing conversion funnels to developing an LLM-powered data extraction system for equity research.

Across my projects, I focus on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights, cutting through the noise and applying technical rigor. I’m passionate about designing data systems that not only generate measurable business impact but also make analytics accessible and scalable.


## Sample projects
On this website, I’ve featured a few open-source projects to give a taste of my skills and interests as they relate to data science. Check them out in the tabs above or the links below.


### Predicting credit card fraud

Fraud can occur in a variety of forms, but machine learning is often the strongest approach to detect fraud. In [this repository](https://github.com/fxpena/fraud_detection), I train and cross-validate ML models to predict credit card fraud. One of the major obstacles for this task is that 98% of card transactions are not fraud. In other words, the dataset is highly imbalanced. Most of my approach can be adapted to training machine learning models for other business cases with highly imbalanced data such as ACH fraud, loan default, purchase conversion, and more.
