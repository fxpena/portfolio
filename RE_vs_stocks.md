title: Real estate vs stocks
---
What's the better investment decision, real estate or stocks?
Many people tend to build wealth by investing in the stock market or investing in real estate. In 2021, more than half of Americans, 52%, are invested in the stock market (Gallup poll), and an even greater majority, 63%, own real estate (Census Bureau). Thereâ€™s no data on how many people own both stocks and real estate, but it seems that many people focus on one or the other, rarely both. 
Which begs the question: which type of investor is winning, real estate or stock market? 
Or are they both achieving the same ROI? How does this result vary across states and cities throughout the US? 
How can you make an informed decision for your own geography and financial goals?
