title: Real estate vs stocks
---
## What's the better investment decision, real estate or an index fund?
Many people tend to build wealth by investing in the stock market or investing in real estate. In 2021, more than half of Americans, 52%, are invested in the stock market ([Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx)), and an even greater majority, 63%, own real estate (Census Bureau). Which type of investor is winning, real estate or stock market? 
- Or are they both achieving the same return on investment? 
- How does this result vary across states and cities throughout the US? 
- How can *you* make an informed decision for your own geography and financial goals?

## Look at my notebook [here](https://github.com/fxpena/RE_v_stocks/blob/main/RE_v_stocks.ipynb) to find out how important location can be for outcompeting an index fund.
Eventually, I may turn the analysis in the notebook into an app where a user could browse scenarios based the year, state, or city of their choosing.
