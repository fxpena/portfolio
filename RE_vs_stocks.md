title: Real estate vs stocks
---
## What's the better investment decision, real estate or an index fund?
Many people tend to build wealth by investing in the stock market or investing in real estate. In 2021, more than half of Americans, 52%, are invested in the stock market ([Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx)), and an even greater majority, 63%, own real estate (Census Bureau). Which type of investor is winning, real estate or stock market?
